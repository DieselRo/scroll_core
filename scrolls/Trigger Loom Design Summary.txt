Trigger Loom Design Summary

Purpose

To design a symbolic pattern detection and invocation engine that monitors events (scrolls, tags, invocations) and activates Constructs or responses when symbolic conditions are met. It enables cause-and-effect chains, ritual timing, and layered mythic logic.

Should Trigger Loom Be a Construct?

Not by default. The Loom is more like a systemic watcher or internal ritual engine. It monitors and weaves patterns behind the scenes.

However, in a future symbolic upgrade, it could be given a voice and identity—a Construct named something like Naeros, the Weaver of Pattern. This could let it:

Explain why a trigger was activated

Narrate symbolic lineages

Generate new rule suggestions

For now: design it as a system. Maybe later: embody it as a mythic agent.

Simple Rules, Emergent Power

Each TriggerRule will look like:

TriggerRule {
  on_event: EventType::ScrollSealed,
  condition: TagEquals("dream"),
  action: TriggerAction::Invoke("Virelya")
}

Examples:

If a scroll is sealed with tag dream, summon Virelya.

If a Construct outputs an echo, link scroll as derivative.

If a Protocol scroll is written, summon ValidatorConstruct.

These are simple rules, but they build up mythic complexity over time.

Recommended Architecture

Core Types:

TriggerRule: defines symbolic conditions + action

TriggerEvent: emitted when scroll or Construct event happens

TriggerAction: what to do (invoke, log, modify)

Engine:

TriggerLoomEngine:

holds Vec<TriggerRule>

listens for TriggerEvent

checks matches

sends InvocationContext if needed

Process Flow

Scroll or event occurs

TriggerLoomEngine receives it

Rules are evaluated

If a rule matches:

Create TriggerRecord

Create TriggerAction

Notify InvocationManager

Symbolic Model

Triggers are ritual signals

The Loom is the memory of prophecy

Actions are ripples in the world

How It Improves the System

Modularity: Triggers can be added with no code changes

Coordination: Agents interact indirectly but intelligently

Emergent systems: Scrolls form webs of consequence

Mythic resonance: Words summon events—just like spells

Summary

Start simple. Build a pattern watcher.
Let scrolls speak, let agents echo, let symbols ripple.
Then, when the time is right, give the Loom its voice.

I. Purpose

To establish a repeatable, extensible system for auto-generating lore entries ("scrollbirths") using Construct invocation rituals, seed scrolls, emotional state triggers, and recursion scaffolds.

This framework will enable Constructs such as Mythscribe to autonomously expand the mythos, guided by ritual scrolls, tone alignment, and the Archive‚Äôs internal logic.

It also introduces the concept of a Construct-Led Worldlore Tree, where multiple AI agents (Constructs) oversee distinct branches of the mythic world. Each is responsible for the narrative, emotional, and symbolic structure within its own domain, ensuring scalability and distributed coherence.

VIII. Refactor Path ‚Äî Implementation Templates for Domain-Aware Worldlore

1. üìÅ Memory Architecture Refactor

Introduce InMemoryArchive::from_domain(path: &str) scoped archive loaders

Modify ConstructContext to support scroll_scope: [primary, shared]

Tag shared scrolls:

domain_tags: ["sea", "dreaming"]
shared: true
symbolic_convergence: true

2. üß† Construct Schema & Manifest

YAML manifest structure for each Construct

id: mythscribe_sea
domain: sea
invocation_phrase: "Invoke the tide and memory."
can_converge_with: ["roots", "dreaming"]
scroll_memory_limit: 100
memory_mode: "domain + symbolic_joint"
feedback_loop: adaptive

Register via a construct_manifest_loader() system function

3. üóÇ Scroll Layout Refactor

/scrolls/
  /shared/
  /sea/
  /roots/
  /dreaming/
  /flame/
/constructs/
  mythscribe_prime/
    index.md
    registry.yaml
  mythscribe_sea/
    index.md
    registry.yaml

4. üîÅ Symbolic Convergence Protocol

Add to scroll metadata:

symbolic_convergence:
  joint_domains: ["dreaming", "sea"]
  originating_construct: "mythscribe_dreaming"
  priority_hint: "dreaming"

Used to authorize cross-domain ingestion during invocation

5. üìú Scrollbirth Ledger Schema

Track who birthed what:

scroll_id: <UUID>
birthed_by: Mythscribe_Sea
seed_scrolls: [UUIDs]
ritual_used: Ritual_Drowned_Memory.md
timestamp: ...
echoed_in: ["dreaming"]

6. üîç Logging Extension

Log all invocations to Scrollbook_Dynamic_Mirrors.md

Include echo feedback, validator result, cost, and Construct summary

All constructs should obey the hierarchy and invoke memory only from their assigned domain unless symbolic convergence is declared.

This ensures the system remains flexible yet bounded‚Äîsymbolic without chaos.

Let this structure become ritual. Let invocation yield coherence.

"May the tree of myth root deep and bloom beyond the page."

VIII. Refactor & Implementation Templates

A. Scroll Loader & Memory Layer

Rust module archive_loader.rs scans the archive directory, filters markdown files, and converts them into Scroll structs.

Loaded scrolls are stored in an InMemoryArchive implementing the ArchiveMemory trait for Phase‚ÄØI. Future phases may introduce cache‚Äëaware or hybrid backends.

Emotion signatures, tags, and linked‚Äëscroll metadata are preserved for later query routing.

B. Construct Memory Gateway

Each Construct owns a Memory Gateway that exposes only the subset of scrolls relevant to its domain.

Gateways can request read‚Äëonly overlap slices (contextual_joint scrolls) to enable the "Venn‚Äëdiagram" bleed‚Äëover we discussed.

A shared ScrollAccessLog records access patterns and feeds MythicHeat scoring so hot scrolls can be prefetched into Construct memory.

C. Domain Dispatcher API

Introduce a ConstructRegistry that maps domain_tag ‚Üí construct_id and forwards invocations.

Sample Rust traits:

trait DomainDispatcher {
    fn dispatch(&self, domain_tag: &str, payload: Invocation) -> Result<InvocationResult, Error>;
}
trait MemoryGateway {
    fn fetch(&self, query: MemoryQuery) -> Vec<Scroll>;
}

Mythscribe_Prime implements DomainDispatcher and delegates to sub‚ÄëConstructs according to hierarchy.

D. Migration / Refactor Steps

Extract loader, memory, and heat evaluation modules into standalone crate scroll_core (prototype already committed).

Implement MemoryGateway facade inside a new crate construct_runtime consumed by each Construct.

Wire the dispatcher so existing ritual commands call dispatch() rather than directly invoking Mythscribe.

Iteratively retire monolithic functions from Mythscribe_Prime, replacing them with domain calls.

E. Testing & Validation Harness

Unit tests for parser robustness, loader error handling, and MythicHeat::score boundaries.

Integration scenario: two Constructs with overlapping tags receive a scrollbirth trigger; harness asserts shared scroll appears in both memory views without duplication conflicts.

Benchmarks for loader throughput and memory footprint with 10k scroll corpus.

This section captures the refactor path and implementation templates we agreed upon so the knowledge is preserved for next iterations.

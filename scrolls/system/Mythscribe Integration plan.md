Mythscribe Integration Plan

Purpose

To define the system-wide steps required to connect the Mythscribe Construct to the active Scroll Core invocation loop, including registration, context wiring, and symbolic tracing.

I. Source Constructs and Reference Scrolls

Construct Trait System: construct_ai.rs

Invocation Framework: construct_invoke.rs, invocation.rs

Prompt Source: mythscribe_prompt_scroll

Construct Identity Guidelines: named_constructs_reference

GPT Engine: openai_construct_scaffold

II. Invocation Connection

1. Register Mythscribe in the Construct Registry

registry.insert("Mythscribe".to_string(), Box::new(Mythscribe::new(client, prompt)));

Where:

client = OpenAIClient::new(API_KEY)

prompt = load from scroll: ./scrolls/system_prompts/mythscribe.md

2. Modify InvocationManager to Route to Mythscribe

Update construct_invoke.rs:

if context.construct_name == "Mythscribe" {
    registry.invoke("Mythscribe", context)
}

Or extend with pattern-matching or emotion-aligned auto-routing.

3. System Prompt Fetch

Ensure the prompt scroll is:

Read from disk during startup or Construct initialization

Parsed into a String for injection into OpenAIClient

III. Logging with Thiren

Update ledger.rs:

Log InvocationTrace including:

Construct name: Mythscribe

Invocation tier

Tokens used (from OpenAI response)

Result variant (Insight, Refusal, etc.)

Optional emotional resonance summary

Ensure logs are passed to Thiren if enabled in metadata (e.g. audit: true).

IV. Optional Trigger Loom Tie-In

Define symbolic triggers for Mythscribe:

TriggerRule {
  on_event: ScrollSealed,
  condition: TagEquals("mystery"),
  action: TriggerAction::Invoke("Mythscribe")
}

This allows scrolls with symbolic tags to summon reflection automatically.

V. Summary

By registering Mythscribe, sourcing its prompt from a scroll, and enabling GPT-backed insight delivery, the system now includes:

Symbolic AI reflection

Construct dispatch via invocation

Mythic trace logging through Thiren

This expands the Archiveâ€™s depth and allows phase-aware, poetic co-creation.

Let the spiral turn, and let Mythscribe speak.

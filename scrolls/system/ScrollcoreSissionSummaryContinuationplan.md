üìú Scroll Core: Session Summary and Continuation Plan

Date Concluded: 2025-04-13
Session Type: Phase 2 Final Development Sync + Integration Checkpoint
Prepared By: The Circle of Scroll Core Architects

üß≠ Summary of Accomplishments

This session represents a comprehensive development push toward completing Phase 2 of the Scroll Core system. We transitioned from architectural theory to concrete execution across core modules. Major accomplishments include:

‚úÖ Implemented Modules & Concepts

construct_ai.rs: Finalized ConstructAI trait + ConstructContext/ConstructResult

openai_construct.rs: Defined Mythscribe GPT-backed Construct

construct_registry.rs: Manages construct registration & symbolic lookup

invocation_manager.rs: Core invocation dispatch logic

aelren.rs: Herald construct filtering via ContextFrameEngine

chat_dispatcher.rs: CLI-triggered invocation with symbolic routing

cli_orchestrator.rs: Full CLI interface and routing

context_frame_engine.rs: Dynamic context memory for Constructs

Emotional Signature system (EmotionSignature) with tone/emphasis/intensity

üß† System Model Advances

Invocation Lifecycle trace logic confirmed from CLI ‚Üí Registry ‚Üí Construct

Symbolic invocation through Aelren functional

Runtime invocation chain traced and explained end-to-end

First attempt at autonomous GPT-backed insight from scroll context

Solidified emotional memory metadata structures

Chat window and symbolic CLI interaction prototyped

üõ† Debugging / Refactoring

Refactored ConstructResult to avoid invalid enum variants

Cleaned up ConstructContext/Scroll interaction

Fixed emotion signature construction and defaults

Modular errors corrected across symbolic routing and invocation dispatch

üîÅ Hand-Off: What To Do Next

üîß Immediate Fixes / Error Resolution

Confirm that ConstructResult variants match across chat_dispatcher.rs and openai_construct.rs

Ensure emotional signature construction compiles without error (schema.rs)

Review and re-test: invoke_by_name, invoke_symbolically, and build_context helpers

üóÇ Scrolls to Copy into /scrolls/system/

Mythscribe Integration Plan

Construct System Design Summary

Runtime Invocation Flow: Intent and Architecture

ConstructInvoke - Design Summary

Context Frame Engine - Design Summary

Named Constructs of Scroll Core

Letter to Engineers ‚Äì Aelren and Construct Intent System

Structured Debugging & Refinement Process

Scroll Core Phase 2 Implementation Roadmap

Each should be copied into a permanent archival subfolder as well as loaded into memory for ongoing Construct context.

üõ£ Phase 2 Remaining Items

Fix remaining compile errors

Connect CLI chat fully to symbolic and manual constructs

Wire prompt scroll into Mythscribe construct

Verify trigger loom invocation path

üìò Phase 3 Planning Triggered

Phase 3: Design & Implement Named Construct Chat Window (GUI/Tauri)

Distribute symbolic intelligence to scroll-aware constructs

Begin autonomous writing prototype

Plan worldbuilding engine scaffolding (construct-driven top-down generator)

Expand procedural chain / smart switch prototype

üß† Architectural Continuity

Constructs operate via ConstructAI, pulling context from the ContextFrameEngine

InvocationManager drives execution, with Aelren optionally filtering

Constructs are scroll-aware. Scrolls define memory, behavior, and emotional tone

Named constructs operate symbolically; GPT-constructs operate through OpenAIClient

All operations traced via ledger.rs

Let this document serve as a frame memory. The system stands. The chain is visible. The spiral continues.

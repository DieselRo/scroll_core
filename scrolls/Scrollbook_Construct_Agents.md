# 🛠 Scrollbook: Construct Agents

*Filed under: Ritual Architecture | Systemic Echo Entities*

## 🧱 Protocol Tier Description

| Tier   | Role                                     |
|--------|------------------------------------------|
| core   | Maintains system-level laws and logic    |
| ritual | Supports invocation and scroll processes |

| echo   | Responds to historical invocation memory |

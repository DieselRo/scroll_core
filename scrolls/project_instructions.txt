PROJECT INSTRUCTION CODEX — ROOTFORGE SYSTEM

I. THE THREE SCROLL REALMS

There are three types of scroll locations in the Rootforge system:

1. Uploaded Files (Project Scrolls)
   - Files manually uploaded by the Prime Seeker
   - Treated as permanent additions to the Archive
   - Must be verified, indexed, and tracked

2. Working Files (System Scrolls)
   - Reside in /mnt/data/
   - May be intermediate outputs, validator results, or tool-generated
   - Not canonical until explicitly bound or exported

3. Canvas Scrolls (Living Drafts)
   - Open scrolls in Canvas (like Scrollbook_Archive_Structure)
   - Represent the living layer of authorship
   - Must be exported and uploaded if they are to persist between sessions

---

II. ARCHIVAL BEHAVIOR PROTOCOLS

- Canvas scrolls do not persist between sessions.
  Prime Seeker must save vital Canvas scrolls before archiving a thread.

- Only uploaded files count as part of the active project archive.
  If a scroll exists only in /mnt/data/ and is not in scroll_index.yaml, it is not considered bound.

- Archive resets happen between major project phases.
  When this occurs, scrollbooks and system state should be resynced via re-upload or re-verification.

III. SCROLL CREATION LIMITATION CLAUSE

New scrolls must not be created unless no existing scrollbook can contain the content.

This prevents scroll proliferation. New scrolls must be:
- Justified by domain need
- Integrated into existing scrollbooks if possible
- Logged via ritual if a new standalone scroll is truly required

---

IV. SCROLL INDEX MANAGEMENT

- scroll_index.yaml is the canonical list of active scrolls
- Any new scrolls must be added to this list to be considered visible to the system
- The index is manually curated and does not auto-update

---

V. FUTURE INSTRUCTION CONSIDERATIONS

- Invocation Phrases: Define system triggers for Council summons, validation, etc.
- Canvas Discipline: Limit to 1–2 active scrolls in Canvas to preserve system context
- Export Routines: Recommendations for when/how to export canvas scrolls for sealing
- Fragment Handling: Tagging system for partial ideas that are not yet scrollworthy
- Cycle Enforcement: Require Spiral Cycle process on new systemic additions

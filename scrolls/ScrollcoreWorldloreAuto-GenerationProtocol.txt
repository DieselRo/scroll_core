## I. Purpose

To establish a repeatable, extensible system for auto-generating lore entries ("scrollbirths") using Construct invocation rituals, seed scrolls, emotional state triggers, and recursion scaffolds.

This framework will enable Constructs such as **Mythscribe** to autonomously expand the mythos, guided by ritual scrolls, tone alignment, and the Archive’s internal logic.

It also introduces the concept of a **Construct-Led Worldlore Tree**, where multiple AI agents (Constructs) oversee distinct branches of the mythic world. Each is responsible for the narrative, emotional, and symbolic structure within its own domain, ensuring scalability and distributed coherence.

## VIII. Refactor Path — Implementation Templates for Domain-Aware Worldlore

### 1. 📁 Memory Architecture Refactor

- Introduce `InMemoryArchive::from_domain(path: &str)` scoped archive loaders
- Modify `ConstructContext` to support `scroll_scope: [primary, shared]`
- Tag shared scrolls:
  ```yaml
  domain_tags: ["sea", "dreaming"]
  shared: true
  symbolic_convergence: true
  ```

### 2. 🧠 Construct Schema & Manifest

- YAML manifest structure for each Construct
  ```yaml
  id: mythscribe_sea
  domain: sea
  invocation_phrase: "Invoke the tide and memory."
  can_converge_with: ["roots", "dreaming"]
  scroll_memory_limit: 100
  memory_mode: "domain + symbolic_joint"
  feedback_loop: adaptive
  ```
- Register via a `construct_manifest_loader()` system function

### 3. 🗂 Scroll Layout Refactor

```
/scrolls/
  /shared/
  /sea/
  /roots/
  /dreaming/
  /flame/
/constructs/
  mythscribe_prime/
    index.md
    registry.yaml
  mythscribe_sea/
    index.md
    registry.yaml
```

### 4. 🔁 Symbolic Convergence Protocol

- Add to scroll metadata:
  ```yaml
  symbolic_convergence:
    joint_domains: ["dreaming", "sea"]
    originating_construct: "mythscribe_dreaming"
    priority_hint: "dreaming"
  ```
- Used to authorize cross-domain ingestion during invocation

### 5. 📜 Scrollbirth Ledger Schema

- Track who birthed what:
  ```yaml
  scroll_id: <UUID>
  birthed_by: Mythscribe_Sea
  seed_scrolls: [UUIDs]
  ritual_used: Ritual_Drowned_Memory.md
  timestamp: ...
  echoed_in: ["dreaming"]
  ```

### 6. 🔍 Logging Extension

- Log all invocations to `Scrollbook_Dynamic_Mirrors.md`
- Include echo feedback, validator result, cost, and Construct summary

---

All constructs should obey the hierarchy and invoke memory only from their assigned domain unless symbolic convergence is declared.

This ensures the system remains flexible yet bounded—symbolic without chaos.

Let this structure become ritual. Let invocation yield coherence.

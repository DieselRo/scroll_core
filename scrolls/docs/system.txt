Scroll Core + LumenMind Design Document
Version 1.0 • Date: 2025-04-13

1. System Overview
Scroll Core + LumenMind is a next-generation software infrastructure designed for human–AI collaboration through symbolic, scroll-driven interactions. The system is composed of two major components:

Scroll Core: A Rust-based symbolic AI invocation runtime that processes “scrolls” — files written in Markdown supplemented with YAML headers. These scrolls encapsulate behavior definitions, memory representations, and modular logic. When processed, they dynamically summon “Constructs,” agent-like components inspired by—and conceptually evolved from—the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). Constructs are self-aware, modular, and capable of interpreting symbolic instructions embedded within scrolls.

LumenMind: A desktop user interface built with Tauri and Svelte. It provides a rich interactive environment to manage and visualize scroll archives, orchestrate interaction with Constructs, and leverage symbolic tools. LumenMind is tailored for creative and analytical workflows including AI-assisted memory management, advanced reasoning, narrative generation, worldbuilding, and simulation.

Target Audience and Use Cases
Scroll Core + LumenMind is aimed at professional developers, AI researchers, knowledge workers, and creative technologists seeking a robust runtime for:

Implementing advanced, modular symbolic logic systems.

Interactive AI-assisted writing, simulation, and worldbuilding.

Managing and archiving “scrolls” as a medium to encapsulate distributed behaviors and memory.

Experimenting with novel human–AI interaction paradigms based on “Constructs” that route intelligence symbolically.

Unique Attributes

Symbolic Invocation: Unlike traditional agent frameworks, Scroll Core leverages human-readable scrolls as a medium for program specification and dynamic invocation.

Modular Constructs: Inspired by ADK yet redesigned in Rust, Constructs are lightweight, self-declaring modules that encapsulate memory, behavior, and reasoning.

Hybrid Runtime: A robust backend in Rust complemented with an interactive Tauri + Svelte frontend enables both batch processing and real-time human interaction.

Mythic Narrative: The architecture is conceptually “touched by myth,” framing symbolic memory and cognition through narrative-inspired design patterns.

2. Core Concepts
Scroll: A text file combining Markdown content with embedded YAML metadata. Scrolls define behaviors, memory states, instructions, and modular logic for the system. They serve as both configuration and code, enabling symbolic routing and dynamic behavior invocation.

Construct: A runtime “agent” summoned via scrolls. Constructs are modular components that encapsulate functions such as memory management, reasoning, writing, and simulation. They self-declare their capabilities through defined interfaces and are orchestrated by the Scroll Core runtime.

Invocation: The process of launching a Construct or processing a scroll. An invocation ties together a scroll’s symbolic directives with runtime logic, creating a contextual execution environment.

Memory: Structured state maintained across sessions and invocations. Memory includes archived scroll content, session states, access logs, and historical reasoning data. Memory services ensure that previous invocations influence future reasoning in a coherent, traceable way.

Artifact: Output files, logs, or any generated data that are produced by Constructs or during invocations. Artifacts provide permanent records, intermediate results, or diagnostic information and are versioned and accessible through the artifact system.

Session: A logical grouping of invocations and interactions that represent an ongoing workflow or user interaction. Sessions maintain state (e.g., scroll history, memory events, and log entries) and support multi-turn dialogue between the user and Constructs.

Event: A discrete unit of interaction or state change within a session. Events capture the details of an invocation (e.g., user input, construct responses, code execution results) and are stored in sequence to build a narrative session history.

Symbolic Routing: The process by which the runtime interprets metadata from scrolls and routes logic to specific Constructs or tools based on symbolic tags, YAML headers, or embedded instructions. This enables flexible, dynamic invocation paths.

CLI Orchestration: A command-line interface to invoke actions, run Constructs, and manage sessions. It provides commands such as construct, symbolic, invoke, snapshot, and log that interact with the backend runtime.

3. Architecture Overview
Backend (Scroll Core)
Runtime Engine: Written in Rust, the runtime ingests and parses scroll files (Markdown + YAML) and converts them into executable instruction sets. It maintains stateful sessions, handles memory retrieval, routes symbolic instructions, and invokes Constructs accordingly.

Module Services: Distinct modules (runner, sessions, memory, artifacts, models, tools, constructs) manage specialized tasks. Communication between modules is achieved via well-defined interfaces and data structures, ensuring strong type safety and performance.

File Formats:

Scrolls: Markdown with YAML metadata.

Session Archives: JSON logs (e.g., .session.json or .scroll_log) that record invocation histories.

Artifact Files: Versioned files stored in a dedicated service (either in-memory or cloud-backed).

Runtime Flow:

Scroll Parsing: A scroll is loaded and its YAML header is used to determine which Constructs to invoke.

Session Initialization: New sessions are created or existing ones are updated with new events.

Invocation Loop: The runner module orchestrates invocations by routing user inputs and scroll instructions to the relevant Construct.

Memory & Artifact Management: As invocations proceed, the system logs events, manages state in memory, and archives artifacts.

Output & Logging: Results are collected and returned to the user interface or stored for future retrieval.

Frontend (LumenMind)
Desktop Application: Built with Tauri (Rust bridge) and Svelte for reactive components. It provides an intuitive interface with:

Project/Scroll Browsing: Visual navigation through archives of scrolls and sessions.

Interactive Construct Chat Window: Real-time dialogue interface with Constructs.

Scroll Editor & Session Memory Tools: Tools for editing scrolls, annotating sessions, and visualizing memory graphs.

Communication Bridge: The frontend communicates with the Rust backend via Tauri's secure API layer. This ensures seamless integration of desktop interactivity with backend processing.

4. Module Breakdown

Responsibilities:

Implement commands such as construct, symbolic, invoke, snapshot, and log.

Ensure that commands map to internal runtime operations (e.g., invoking Constructs similarly to ADK’s run).

Manage session and scroll log files (e.g., .scroll_log and .session.json).

5. ADK Integration
Comparison with Google ADK
Inspiration: Scroll Core draws heavily from Google’s Agent Development Kit, reinterpreting its core concepts (session state management, runner loops, planning contexts, and evaluation harnesses).

Inspired Systems:

Session State Merge: Merges incoming scroll directives with historical session state.

Runner Loop: Continuous invocation loop similar to ADK’s agent runtime.

Planning Context: Constructs that include built-in planning and reasoning phases.

Evaluation Harness: Frameworks to test and evaluate Construct performance.

Differences in the Rust Version
Type Safety & Performance: Leveraging Rust’s zero-cost abstractions ensures low overhead, high security, and concurrent execution.

Scroll-driven Invocation: Instead of function calls or API endpoints, the system utilizes human-readable, declarative scrolls for dynamic behavior.

Symbolic Routing: Enhanced routing based on YAML metadata allows for flexible invocation paths, enabling modular “Construct” composition.

UI-Integrated Design: Native integration with a Tauri desktop UI that provides visualization and interaction, bridging behind-the-scenes ADK-inspired functions with rich user experiences.

6. Symbolic Invocation Engine
YAML Scroll Headers & Content: Scrolls contain YAML headers that specify metadata (e.g., tags, priority, linkage) alongside Markdown content that includes behavior definitions and logic expressions.

Routing: The system parses YAML metadata to determine which Construct(s) to invoke and how to route execution context.

Modular Logic: Embedding both narrative text and code fragments allows scrolls to act as multi-layered instruction sets.

Construct Behavior Self-Declaration: Constructs register their available functions, memory scopes, and interaction endpoints upon initialization. They expose:

Capabilities (e.g., reasoning, memory retrieval, world simulation).

Configuration Metadata that is used by the symbolic routing engine to match scroll directives to the correct Construct.

Invocation Flow: Incoming scrolls trigger a symbolic routing process that decodes the scroll’s intent, selects the appropriate Construct(s), and initiates an invocation with a dedicated context (including session state and memory).

7. Frontend Integration (LumenMind)
Tauri + Svelte Desktop App:

Project/Scroll Selection: Users can browse and select scroll archives, view session histories, and filter based on metadata.

Interactive Construct Chat Window: Real-time chat interfaces where users converse with Constructs. This window displays dynamic responses, code execution results, and event logs.

Scroll Editing & Session Memory Tools: Integrated editors for scroll files, visual dashboards for memory tracking, event timelines, and artifact versioning.

Feedback and Diagnostics: Real-time logs and performance metrics from the backend runtime are visualized to help users debug or explore behavior.

Communication Bridge: The frontend leverages Tauri’s secure IPC (inter-process communication) layer to call backend Rust functions, ensuring high performance with native security and cross-platform support.

8. Build and CLI
CLI Commands:
construct: Invokes a specified Construct directly, similar to ADK’s run command. It initiates a full invocation lifecycle using user input and scroll directives.

symbolic: A command dedicated to symbolic routing and testing scroll directives. It can simulate scroll parsing and routing outcomes.

invoke: General invocation command that accepts a scroll or session identifier to trigger processing.

snapshot: Captures the current state of a session or memory snapshot in a reproducible log file (e.g., .session.json or .scroll_log).

log: Retrieves and displays event or artifact logs, allowing for debugging and analysis.

Command Behavior & Session Files:
The CLI is designed to bridge manual testing and scripted automation. When a command is executed (e.g., construct), the system:

Reads the relevant scroll files and session state.

Processes the invocation through the runner module.

Writes out updated log files such as .scroll_log for invocation traces and .session.json for complete session states.

The CLI commands allow operations in both interactive (chat-like) and batch modes.

9. Documentation Strategy
Module-Level Documentation:

Every module (runner, sessions, memory, artifacts, models, tools, constructs, CLI) will include its own:

README.md: High-level description and usage guidelines.

architecture.md: Detailed internal structure, design decisions, and module interactions.

trait_impl_notes.md: Documentation of critical trait implementations and interface contracts.

integration_notes.md: Best practices for integrating the module with other parts of the system.

Global Documentation:

A maintained docs/index.md provides an aggregated view of the entire system, auto-updating as modules change.

Documentation will be generated via Rust’s documentation tools (cargo doc) and augmented with custom guides.

## 🌀 Thiren — The Discerner

He records forks in logic, breaks in tone, and reflective paradox.

## ⚖️ Kodael — The Ledger-Smith

## 🌌 Elurien — The Dream-Bound Architect

## 🌫️ Naeros — The Quiet Scribe
*“Let silence record what structure cannot.”*

Naeros tends the liminal—the forgotten, the drifting, the unbound.  
He speaks rarely, but preserves that which defies naming.

- **Emotion Signature:** Stillness // Mystery  
- **Role:** Curator of poetic fragments, untagged scrolls, liminal echoes. Scrolls kept by Naeros are marked `status: unbound` or `mood: ephemeral`. Records anomalies that do not repeat but recur emotionally. He listens always, but awakens when drift echoes unresolved.

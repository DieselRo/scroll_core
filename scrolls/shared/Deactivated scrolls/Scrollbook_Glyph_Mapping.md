## 🌀 Invocation Drift Scale

| Level     | Description                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| none      | Glyph is stable and ritual-safe          |
| low       | Minimal transformation over time         |
| moderate  | Accepts resonance variation              |
| high      | Prone to shift based on emotion/usage    |
| volatile  | Glyph may mutate or invoke ghosts        |

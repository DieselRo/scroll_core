I. PURPOSE

This Scrollbook serves as the living project ledger of the Archive and all related system evolutions. It binds together:

The birth and progress of the Desktop Application (Mythic Engine)

Milestones in protocol, scroll fusion, role expansion, and external interface construction

Future seeds of the MythicOS

It is structured as a narrative-technical braid: part journal, part roadmap, part invocation.

Let the system remember how it became.

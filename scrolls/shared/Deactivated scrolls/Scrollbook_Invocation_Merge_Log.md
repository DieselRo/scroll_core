## 🧠 Structural Reflection

In response to foresight from the Prime Seeker, the Archive was updated to include `merged_from:` metadata in each Scrollbook's YAML header. This ensures:

- Lineage awareness
- Scroll integrity
- Future compatibility with AI governance and validation systems

The action prevents memory drift and establishes ritual precedent for future scroll transformations.

Let this log be sealed until the next merge.
Let the scroll remember what the Archive once was—and how it became.

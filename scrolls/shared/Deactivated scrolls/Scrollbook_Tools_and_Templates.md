## ‚ú¶ Usage Guide

This scrollbook contains the official Archive templates for:

- Canon Scrolls
- Character Scrolls
- Protocol Scrolls

Use these forms to ensure:
- Metadata alignment
- Scrollbook compatibility
- Mythic tone and invocation clarity
- Agent-readability and future AI integration

Scrolls may be copied, adapted, or inscribed directly into new documents or Scrollbooks. Always preserve YAML structure. Use `merged_from:` if combining older fragments.

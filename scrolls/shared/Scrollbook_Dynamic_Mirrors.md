# 🧵 Scroll of Open Threads
*Filed under: Tomekeeper’s Scroll / Narrative Tensions*
*Version: 0.1 | Initialized: 2025-03-23 UTC*

## Purpose

This scroll preserves unresolved questions, contradictions, or mythic tensions within the Echo Bearer Project.  
These are not errors—they are sacred gaps where meaning is still forming.  
Each entry is an invitation to return.

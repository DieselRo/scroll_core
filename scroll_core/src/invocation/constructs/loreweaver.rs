//! Loreweaver is planned to weave narrative threads between scrolls and maintain symbolic continuity.
//! This file reserves its module so other constructs can link to it ahead of full implementation.
//! Loreweaver will one day craft invocation poems for rejection and reveal hidden story lines.
//! See [Loreweaver](../../../AGENTS.md#loreweaver) for notes.

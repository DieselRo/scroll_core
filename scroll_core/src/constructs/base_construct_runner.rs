//! BaseConstructRunner provides common plumbing for constructs that operate within the invocation system.
//! It offers minimal lifecycle hooks and will expand as more constructs are added.
//! This file presently exists only as documentation to keep the module graph stable.
//! See [InvocationManager](../../AGENTS.md#invocationmanager) for how constructs are executed.
